# ProstheticControlsESP32S2
***THIS PROJECT IS NOW OUT OF DATE. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON CONVERTING THE CODE FROM A SUPER LOOP ARCHITECTURE TO RTOS. A LINK TO THE NEW PROJECT WILL BE PROVIDED WHEN THE INTIAL RELEASE IS STABLE***

This project is the continuation of the effort by York College of Pennsylvania
to develop an affordable DIY prosthetic arm for below the elbow amputations. 
This project will utilize the ESP32-S2-DevKitM-1(u) created by espressif.
